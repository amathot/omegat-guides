## Your user Name/ID

When opening OmegaT for the first time, please update your Name/ID. To do that click on **Options** > **Preferences** > **Team**. 

The Name/ID box might already contain your username. If that's the case, please prepend your username with `VER_`.

If the box is empty, please enter `VER_your-name` (e.g. `VER_souto`, `VER_msoutopico`, etc.).

Then press OK.
