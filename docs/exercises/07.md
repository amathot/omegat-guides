# Section 07. Search: AM

	@Å§odo: review

Using the search function (which you can open with Ctrl+F), try to find the following segments in the project:

1. Look for "Rather unsatisfied", there is one instact which was not translated consistenly.
	
	> @quiz: can you find it?

2. Uncheck all options except for notes. Can you find the segment with "How" in a note?
3. Using the "Search in" options, try to find the translation of "translator" in the translation memories.
4. Using the options, find "Subject", but only if it has a translation.
