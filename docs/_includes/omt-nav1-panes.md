## Navigation between the different panes

When you open OmegaT you will notice the screen is split in several panes:

  * The **Editor pane** is the main pane in which you will be working.
  * Translation suggestions will appear in the **Fuzzy Matches pane**.
  * The **Glossary pane** will display the existing glossary entries and the ones you may add.
  * The **Multiple Translations pane** will show you if a repeated segment was translated differently.
