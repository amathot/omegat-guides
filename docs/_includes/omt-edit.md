# Editing

## Revising the translation

Move through segments one by one by pressing the **Enter** key. When you press the **Enter** key, you move from one segment to the next one, activating the segment you jump to. 

Read every translation, comparing with the source text. You may have received more specific instructions for your particular task. 

<!-- @todo: no section about revision: go through segments one by one pressing Enter.. or wahtever.. read one by one...? -->

<!-- RFF: ask Kos to add option to filter: segments with translation from x-auto or x-enforce or both, or segments that do not have a translation coming from x-auto, or that do not have a translation coming from x-enforce, or both

segments with translations from 
☑️ /tm/auto

## Editing a segment to correct an error

To make a segment editable, you must activate it. You can only edit the active segment. You can recognize the active segment because it is highlighted in green.

You can also activate a specific segment by double-clicking it. When you double-click a segment, it becomes active and you can then edit it.
