# Creating target files

Press ++ctrl+shift+d++ to create the target file you were working on. This will allow you to preview the translated file with your latest changes.

To access the file, go to **Project** > **Access Project Contents** > **Target Files** to open your file explorer in the `/target` folder of the project. The file you were working on should be there: preview it to read the translation in context.
