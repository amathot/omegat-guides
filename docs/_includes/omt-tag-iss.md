## Fixing tag issues 

All tags you see in the source text should be present in the translation too. You must correct any errors that you may see when that's not the case.

In the screenshot below, in the source segment the **paired tags** **&lt;i&gt;**{ .tag } and **&lt;/i&gt;**{ .tag } are around the letter `n` while in the target they are around the word `which`.

<!-- @todo: use oemgat tags -->

To correct this issue, you would have to perform the following steps:

  1. Double click on the each incorrectly inserted tag in the translation to select it and press ++backspace++ or ++del++ on your keyboard to delete it 
  2. Select the text that must encompassed by the paired tags.
  3. Press ++ctrl+space++ to launch the auto-completer. You might need to press ++ctrl+space++ several times to cycle through the different options until you see the list of tags.
  4. Select the paired tags that you want to insert and press ++enter++.

The tags are inserted around the text you have selected.
