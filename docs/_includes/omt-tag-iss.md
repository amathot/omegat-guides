## Fixing tag issues 

For your language task, all tags should be present in the translation. What is important is to correct potential errors that you may see. In the screenshot below, in the source segment the **double tags** `<i>` and `</i>` are around the letter **"n"** while in the target they are around the word **"which"**.

To correct this issue, you would have to perform the following steps:

  + **double click** on the first incorrectly inserted tag in the target segment to select it and press ++backspace++ on your keyboard to delete it 
  + repeat the operation until you deleted all incorrectly inserted tags
  + place your mouse where the first tag should be correctly inserted and press ++ctrl+t++ on your keyboard to insert the first tag
  + insert all other missing tags.

Please note that tags are inserted in the order of their appearance in the source segment.
