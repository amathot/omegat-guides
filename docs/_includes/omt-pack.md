# Creating your deliverable

Once you have finished editing the OmegaT package and have performed the appropriate QA checks, you need to pack the project.

  * Go to **Project** > **Pack project as OMT file**

  * A pop up window will open.
  * Click Save
  * Press OK in the Pop-up window notifying that the package was successfully created.

  * You will be automatically directed to the location the exported package is stored.
  * You will recognize the package because it has the extension `.omt`. It should be the 4th from the bottom.
