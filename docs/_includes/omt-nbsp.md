In order to insert non-breaking spaces in OmegaT, please make sure you have installed **Auto Hot Key**. If you haven't installed it yet, please check the **Third Party Tools** section of the [OmegaT Installation guide](/doku.php?id=ug:tec-cb-ome-ins)

Once **Auto Hot Key** is installed, you can insert non-breaking spaces with the same keyboard shortcut as in Word: **Ctrl+Shift+Space**. You can recognize a non breaking space because it is gray.
