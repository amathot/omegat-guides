# Accessing the project

## Accessing the project for the first time

The following steps need to be performed __only once per OmegaT package__: when you access each package for the first time: 

1. Download the **OMT package** from the portal.

2. Store the **OMT package** in a location you will remember on your computer.<!-- tips on file organization -->

3. Unpack the project from the **OMT package**:
  
    + Launch OmegaT.
  
    + Go to **Project** > **Unpack project from OMT file**:<!-- update screenshot -->

    + Navigate to the location where you stored the OMT package. Select the **OMT package** and click on Open:

4. You can now perform your task in the project.

When you are done working for the day, quit OmegaT (++ctrl+q++).

## Accessing the project after it has been unpacked

The next times you want to access the project in OmegaT, go to **Project** > **Open Recent Project**. The project you were working on will appear in the list:
