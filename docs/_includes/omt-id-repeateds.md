You can recognize that you are in a repeated segment because it has gray font.
When a repeated segment is active, the segment number will indicate how many repetitions exist:

If you **right click** on a repeated segment, the contextual menu will point out the other occurrences of a repeated segment. It can be useful to jump to them (by selecting them from the contextual menu) to see the different contexts in which a repeated segment appears.
