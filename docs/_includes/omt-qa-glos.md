## Check glossary adherence

You can check whether the translation adheres to the glossary and key terms have been translated consistently throughout:

  * Go to **Tools>Check Issues**
  * Make sure the box next to **Terminology Issues** is ticked

  * Press** OK.** 
  * An error report will open

  * Go through the issues one by one and jump to segment to correct the potential error if needed.

!!! note "Tip" 
    Not all flagged issues are errors by default. In some cases, you may get false positives. In the screenshot below, "apple trees" should be translated as "pommiers" as in the first segment. In the second segment (active segment) "apple trees" was rendered as "ces arbres" (backtranslation: these trees) to avoid a repetition that would be disturbing in French. Such deviations from the glossary are intentional.
