Press **Ctrl+Shift+D** to create the target file you were working on. This will allow you to preview the translated file with your changes.

To access the file, go to **Project>Access Project Contents>Target Files**. A window with the contents of the "target" folder will open. Find the file you were working on, if there are several files and preview it to read the translation in context.
