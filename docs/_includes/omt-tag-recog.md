There are two types of tags - standalone tags and double tags:

  * **Standalone tags**: a single tag with a precise role (e.g. **&lt;x1/&gt;**{ .tag } tag which introduces a new paragraph in HTML)
  * **Paired tags** are composed of an opening tag and a closing tag (e.g. **&lt;g1&gt;**{ .tag } and **&lt;/g1&gt;**{ .tag }) and affect the text between them and you need to ensure they are positioned around the exact same words in the translation as in the source text.
