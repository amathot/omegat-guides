## Inserting tags

To insert tags in your translation, you should use the keyboard shortcut ++ctrl+t++, which inserts the next missing tag.

Please note that tags are inserted in the order of their appearance in the source segment. If you need to insert tags in a different order than in the source, we advise you to translate the entire segment, place your cursor where the first tag has to be inserted and press ++ctrl+t++, then repeat the operation until all tags have been inserted.

If you have inserted a tag incorrectly and need to **delete** it, **select the tag** in full (you can **double click** on it) and press **backspace** or delete on your keyboard.
