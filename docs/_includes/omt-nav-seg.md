In the editor pane, the active segment is highlighted in green. This is the segment you are working in. When you type or insert a translation, it will appear **below the source text**. 

Press the **Enter** key on your keyboard to go to the next segment. You can also use **Ctrl+U** to jump to the next untranslated segment.
A segment can also be activated by double clicking on it. It then becomes green.

In OmegaT, a **color code** will help you find your way around between the different segments:

  * **Green** = the segment you are working in (active segment)
  * **Blue** = untranslated segment
  * **Grey** = translated segment. The translation is displayed below the source text.
  * **Orange** = pretranslated and locked segment (e.g. trend). If you want to make a change to a trend segment, document it in the Excel Sheet but do not try to change it in OmegaT. Any changes you make to these segments will not be saved. The existing translation will be maintained.
