  * The project files pane will open
  * **OK:** If the **Number of unique segments** __is equal to__ the number of **Translated unique segments**.

  * **NOT OK**: the **Number of unique segments** __is different from__ the number of **Translated unique segments**. To correct: 

  1. Close the Project Files Pane
  1. Press **Ctrl+U** on your keyboard to jump to the __Next Untranslated Segment__. 
  1. When the cursor stops moving from the active segment then all segments have a translation.

Recheck for completion, to make sure by opening the Project Files pane.
